# CSS-Studies
CSS study where I do practice assignment, or I pause a video and do it myself, then see how it was done.

## Section 5
###Adding style to our plans
<p>I didnâ€™t need to use display flex.</p>
<p>This makes sense, I didn't think of making the 'articals' display inline-block;</p>
<p>If I had done that, I wouldn't have known about vertically-aligned that I could use. I may not have done it, even if I thought of it.</p>
<p>I didn't relize font family in button did inherit. Learned that. So if I want keep the style of the text as the rest of my boyd I'll need to use inherit</p>
<p>I learned using width 30% is better then 33% because the spaces can mess it up and push the 3 item on the next line when you make the screen smaller.</p>
